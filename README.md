# IMSnPars at IWPT2020

IMS Neural Dependency Parser is a re-implementation of the transition- and graph-based parsers described in [Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature Representations](https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1023)

The parser was developed for the paper [The (Non-)Utility of Structural Features in BiLSTM-based
Dependency Parsers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1012) (see [acl2019 branch](https://github.com/AgnieszkaFalenska/IMSnPars/tree/acl2019) for all the paper specific changes and analysis tools).

Later, it was changed and used in the paper [Integrating Graph-Based and Transition-Based Dependency Parsers
in the Deep Contextualized Era](https://iwpt20.sigparse.org/pdf/2020.iwpt-1.4.pdf) 

This branch **WILL CONTAIN** all the paper-specific changes and analysis tools. I just have to clean them a little bit before I put them here. Please contact me if you are not scared and want to see the dirty and ugly version of the code earlier.
